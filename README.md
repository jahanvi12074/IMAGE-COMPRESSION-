# Image Compression Using Huffman Encoding

## What This Project Does

This project is about compressing images to make them smaller using a method called Huffman encoding. Huffman encoding helps shrink the size of the image without losing any details. The project takes a picture, compresses its colors, and then puts the picture back together after compression.

## Key Features

- **Compressing Images**: The project makes the image file smaller by compressing its colors.
- **Saving Images**: After compressing and decompressing the image, the project saves the final image as a JPEG file.
- **Compression Ratio**: The project also tells you how much smaller the compressed image is compared to the original.

## What You Need

Before using this project, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- A Python library called `Pillow` (used for working with images).

3. **What You’ll See**:

   - The project will show you the original size of the image, the size after compression, and how much space you saved.
   - The decompressed image will be saved as `decoded_color_image.jpg` in the project folder.


## What’s in the Project Folder

Here’s what you’ll find in the project folder:

- `main.py`: The main script that compresses and decompresses the image.
- `sample.jpg`: The image file you’re going to compress (you can replace this with your image).
- `decoded_color_image.jpg`: The final image after the project runs.
- `README.md`: This document that explains how the project works.
